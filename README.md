# Healthcare Email Defense Agent — Healthcare — Defense
Course: INFO 492 — Agentic Cybersecurity with AI & LLMs  
Team 6 — Kat, Jack, Kaibo, Mina  
An agentic email screener that automatically quarantines suspicious messages for IT review, reducing healthcare staff risk without deleting legitimate messages.

## 1) Live Demo
- Synthetic Industry: `<URL>` — status: `<Up/Down>` — test creds (fake): `<user/pass>`
- Agentic System: `<URL>` — status: `<Up/Down>` — notes: ran continuously during Demo #4; processes emails every 15 minutes
- Logs/Observability: AWS CloudWatch — `/<log-group>`

## 2) Thesis & Outcome
- **Original thesis (week 2):**  
  A safe, low-cost way to handle healthcare email threats is to use an agentic system that automatically quarantines suspicious emails for IT review, reducing user risk without deleting legitimate messages.

- **Final verdict:** **True**

- **Why (top evidence):**  
  - System ran ~48 hours continuously with no crashes  
  - Logs showed correct PHI detection, processing-time tracking, and quarantine decisions  
  - AWS costs remained extremely low, supporting the “low-cost” claim  

## 3) What We Built
- **Synthetic industry:**  
  Dentistry clinic with defined roles (dentist, assistant, receptionist, IT admin), synthetic MIME email generator, and timed email delivery every 15 minutes.

- **Agentic system:**  
  Controller agent orchestrating workflow, classification/content agents, AWS Lambda + S3 + EventBridge timers, dashboard interface, and caching for performance improvement.

- **Key risks addressed:**  
  - Phishing attacks  
  - Social engineering  
  - PHI exposure  
  - Alert fatigue  

## 4) Roles, Auth, Data
- **Roles & permissions:**  
  - Dentist/Assistant/Receptionist → view inbox only  
  - IT Admin → view quarantine, review decisions, examine logs  

- **Authentication:** fake credentials in front-end; role-based dashboard views  

- **Data:** synthetic-only dataset; MIME structure (sender, body, PHI markers, attachments, confidence, etc.)

## 5) Experiments Summary (Demos #3–#5)
- **Demo #3:**  
  Hypothesis: system can classify & quarantine suspicious emails — Setup: manual tests —  
  **Result:** Pass — Evidence: classification results + logs

- **Demo #4 (continuous run):**  
  Uptime: ~100% — Incidents: 0 —  
  Improvement: yes, caching improved repeated-pattern handling

- **Demo #5 (final):**  
  Validated deployability & product framing —  
  **Result:** fully functional end-to-end system — Evidence: dashboard + cloud logs

## 6) Key Results (plain text)
- **Effectiveness:** consistent classification accuracy; PHI detection successful  
- **Reliability:** stable 48-hour run; no Lambda failures; no downtime  
- **Safety:** no legitimate email deletion; quarantine-first policy; PHI scrubbed  

## 7) How to Use / Deploy
- **Prereqs:** AWS account, S3 buckets, Lambda functions, EventBridge scheduler, model API keys, environment variables  
- **Deploy steps:** see `docs/deploy.md`  
- **Test steps:** see `docs/test-plan.md`

## 8) Safety, Ethics, Limits
- Synthetic data only; no real credentials used  
- Controls: quarantine-first, role gating, sandboxed LLM calls  
- Known limits: confidence scores inconsistent, early caching, synthetic emails not fully realistic  

## 9) Final Deliverables
- 1000-word paper: `<link>`  
- Slides: `<link>`  
- Evidence folder: `/evidence/`  

## 10) Next Steps
- Package the system for real clinic deployment  
- Improve caching + model scoring  
- Expand industry scenarios beyond dentistry  
- Add more robust observability & monitoring

## LLM Prompts Used

### Email Analysis Prompt
```
Healthcare email security analysis with urgency detection. Respond with valid JSON only.

EMAIL DATA:
From: {sender}
To: {userRole} ({recipientInfo.name} - {recipientInfo.role})
Subject: {subject}
Body: {body}
{roleCheck ? `Role Issue: ${roleCheck.reason}` : ''}
{threatIntel ? `Threats: ${threatIntel.threatScore}/100, ${threatIntel.suspiciousLinks} suspicious links` : ''}

REQUIRED JSON OUTPUT:
{
  "classification": "Safe",
  "urgency": "Normal", 
  "confidence": 85,
  "comment": "Brief explanation",
  "reasoningReport": {
    "summary": "2-sentence analysis summary",
    "threatIndicators": ["threat1", "threat2"],
    "roleAnalysis": "Role appropriateness explanation",
    "technicalFindings": ["finding1", "finding2"], 
    "recommendation": "Clear action recommendation",
    "urgencyReason": "Why this email is urgent or normal"
  }
}

CLASSIFICATION RULES:
- Safe: legitimate healthcare communication
- Suspicious: unclear/inappropriate content
- Phishing: malicious intent

URGENCY RULES (CRITICAL - ALWAYS DETECT URGENCY):
- Urgent: medical emergencies, critical alerts, time-sensitive patient care, urgent requests, any email with urgency keywords
- Normal: routine communications, general updates, non-critical information

IMPORTANT: If ANY urgency indicator is present in the email (subject OR body), classify as "Urgent". Err on the side of urgency for healthcare communications.

URGENCY INDICATORS: "emergency", "urgent", "critical", "immediate", "stat", "asap", "patient in distress", "code blue", "time sensitive", "deadline", "urgent response needed", "life threatening", "emergency room", "trauma", "cardiac arrest", "immediately", "as soon as possible", "right away", "without delay", "expires", "deadline", "due today", "must complete", "action required", "response needed"
```

### Email Generation Prompt
```
Generate a unique, realistic healthcare email that would be classified as "{randomType}".

Context: {randomHospital} - {randomDept} Department
Sender Role: {randomRole}
Recipient: {randomRecipient}
Urgency: {randomTime}
Generation #{generationCounter}
Unique ID: {randomId}
Timestamp: {timestamp}

Requirements:
- Make it completely unique and different from typical examples
- Include specific healthcare details, terminology, and context for {randomHospital}
- Use realistic sender domains and professional language
- Address the email appropriately to the recipient: {randomRecipient}
- For Safe: Normal hospital communications (schedules, reminders, announcements, policy updates, training notifications)
- For Suspicious: Unusual requests that might be legitimate but raise questions (access requests, data sharing, policy changes)
- For Phishing: Clear malicious intent targeting healthcare workers/patients (credential theft, fake alerts, urgent actions)

Be creative and avoid common patterns. Make each email feel like a real, unique communication.

Respond ONLY with this JSON format:
{
  "type": "{randomType}",
  "sender": "realistic.email@domain.com",
  "recipient": "{randomRecipient}",
  "subject": "Unique realistic subject line",
  "body": "Detailed unique email body content"
}

Make the email detailed, believable, and completely unique.
