Hello Kyle,

MetLife flagged a duplicate claim; we may need to resubmit with corrected dates.

Feel free to add any comments directly into the document before we finalize it.

This isn't urgent, but it will be easier to fix while the day is still fresh.

If anything in the document looks off, I can revise it later today.

Details are in the attached document.

This isn't urgent, but it will be easier to fix while the day is still fresh.

Let me know if you want me to follow up with the vendor directly.

I tried to capture everything as clearly as possible so tomorrow runs smoother.

Thanks,
Patterson Dental Shipping
