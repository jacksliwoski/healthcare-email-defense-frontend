Hello David,

One of the assistants reported that Dentrix was freezing when posting payments.

The secure email portal timed out for a few patients trying to upload forms.

We had a brief internet outage around 10:15 AM; I noted it in the log.

If anything in the document looks off, I can revise it later today.

The attached PDF has all the details summarized.

Best,
Sarah Miller
