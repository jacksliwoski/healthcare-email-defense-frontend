Hey Sarah,

Your SmileClinic provider account has been temporarily restricted due to unusual activity.

To continue, please use the secure link below: https://smileclinic-provider-verify.com/login

A security notice PDF is attached for your records.

If anything in the document looks off, I can revise it later today.

This isn't urgent, but it will be easier to fix while the day is still fresh.

If anything in the document looks off, I can revise it later today.
