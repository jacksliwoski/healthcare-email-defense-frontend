Hello Sarah,

Please review the EOB summary and confirm the write-offs look correct.

MetLife flagged a duplicate claim; we may need to resubmit with corrected dates.

I tried to capture everything as clearly as possible so tomorrow runs smoother.

If anything in the document looks off, I can revise it later today.

Details are in the attached document.

Let me know if you want me to follow up with the vendor directly.

This isn't urgent, but it will be easier to fix while the day is still fresh.

Feel free to add any comments directly into the document before we finalize it.

Best,
BrightSmile Lab Cases
