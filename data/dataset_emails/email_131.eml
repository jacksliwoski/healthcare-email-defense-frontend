Hello David,

The panoramic images for Mr. Hayes and Ms. Turner are now exported.

This isn't urgent, but it will be easier to fix while the day is still fresh.

I tried to capture everything as clearly as possible so tomorrow runs smoother.

Let me know if you want me to follow up with the vendor directly.

Details are in the attached document.

If anything in the document looks off, I can revise it later today.
