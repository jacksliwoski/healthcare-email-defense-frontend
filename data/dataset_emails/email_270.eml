Hi David,

Ticket #10483 for the panoramic x-ray PC in operatory 2 has been resolved.

We updated Windows patches, removed an outdated imaging driver, and confirmed
that the Carestream software launches and captures without freezing.

If the issue returns, please reply to this email within 7 days to reopen the ticket.

Thanks,
Chris O'Dowd
