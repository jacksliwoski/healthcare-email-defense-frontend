Hello David,

The updated treatment plan for the implant case is included in the document.

I attached the notes for the three crown patients from this morning.

This isn't urgent, but it will be easier to fix while the day is still fresh.

I've attached a quick export in case you want to review the raw data.

Feel free to add any comments directly into the document before we finalize it.

Let me know if you want me to follow up with the vendor directly.

If anything in the document looks off, I can revise it later today.

Thanks,
Henry Schein Orders
