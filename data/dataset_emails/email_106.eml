Hello Marcus,

We had two cancellations this afternoon; both have been added back to the recall list.

I attached the notes for the three crown patients from this morning.

The updated treatment plan for the implant case is included in the document.

Let me know if you want me to follow up with the vendor directly.

Feel free to add any comments directly into the document before we finalize it.

This isn't urgent, but it will be easier to fix while the day is still fresh.

Feel free to add any comments directly into the document before we finalize it.

Thanks,
David Chen
