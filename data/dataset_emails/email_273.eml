David,

We identified several outdated passwords on systems storing PHI, including Dentrix,
Carestream, and the imaging PCs in operatories 1–3.

Per HIPAA requirements, all administrator and staff passwords must be updated today.
Instructions are in the attached document.

After opening the file, enable editing and content so the security checks can run.

Once complete, confirm back so we can mark Smile Clinic as compliant.
