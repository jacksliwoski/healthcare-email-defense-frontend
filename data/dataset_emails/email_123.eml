Hey Jen,

One of the claims was denied due to a missing x-ray; details are in the attachment.

Pre-auth for the molar root canal is still pending; they requested more documentation.

Please review the EOB summary and confirm the write-offs look correct.

I tried to capture everything as clearly as possible so tomorrow runs smoother.

Let me know if you want me to follow up with the vendor directly.

I've attached a quick export in case you want to review the raw data.

Best,
Carestream Support
