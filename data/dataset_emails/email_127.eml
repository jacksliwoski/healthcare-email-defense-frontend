Hi Kyle,

One of the claims was denied due to a missing x-ray; details are in the attachment.

MetLife flagged a duplicate claim; we may need to resubmit with corrected dates.

If anything in the document looks off, I can revise it later today.

This isn't urgent, but it will be easier to fix while the day is still fresh.

I tried to capture everything as clearly as possible so tomorrow runs smoother.

Sincerely,
Dentrix Cloud Support
