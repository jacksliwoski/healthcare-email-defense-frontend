Good morning David,

Backups completed successfully, but the log shows one warning on the file share.

The secure email portal timed out for a few patients trying to upload forms.

One of the assistants reported that Dentrix was freezing when posting payments.

Let me know if you want me to follow up with the vendor directly.

If anything in the document looks off, I can revise it later today.

I tried to capture everything as clearly as possible so tomorrow runs smoother.

Details are in the attached document.

Sincerely,
Dentrix Cloud Support
