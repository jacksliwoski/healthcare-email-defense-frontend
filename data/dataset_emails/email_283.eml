Hi David,

Ticket for the intraoral camera PC in operatory 3 has been updated.
We confirmed that images attach correctly to patient charts for Daniel Brooks and others.

If staff still see freezing when capturing x-rays, please send a screenshot and we'll reopen.

You can review ticket history at https://portal.ruraltechit.com.

Thanks,
Chris
Rural Tech IT
