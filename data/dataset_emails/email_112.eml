Hello Dr. Martinez,

One of the claims was denied due to a missing x-ray; details are in the attachment.

If anything in the document looks off, I can revise it later today.

Feel free to add any comments directly into the document before we finalize it.

This isn't urgent, but it will be easier to fix while the day is still fresh.

I tried to capture everything as clearly as possible so tomorrow runs smoother.

Feel free to add any comments directly into the document before we finalize it.

Regards,
Dentrix Cloud Support
