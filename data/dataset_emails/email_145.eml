Hi Sarah,

Delta is asking for additional charting before approving the perio maintenance.

Please review the EOB summary and confirm the write-offs look correct.

One of the claims was denied due to a missing x-ray; details are in the attachment.

If anything in the document looks off, I can revise it later today.

This isn't urgent, but it will be easier to fix while the day is still fresh.

Let me know if you want me to follow up with the vendor directly.

Appreciate it,
Dentrix Cloud Support
