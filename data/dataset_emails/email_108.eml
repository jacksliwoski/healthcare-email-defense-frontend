Hey David,

Can you confirm if the new burs were logged into the supply cabinet?

Let me know if you want me to follow up with the vendor directly.

If anything in the document looks off, I can revise it later today.

This isn't urgent, but it will be easier to fix while the day is still fresh.

The attached PDF has all the details summarized.

Let me know if you want me to follow up with the vendor directly.

Best,
Marcus Thorne
