Good morning Marcus,

Delta is asking for additional charting before approving the perio maintenance.

If anything in the document looks off, I can revise it later today.

Let me know if you want me to follow up with the vendor directly.

I tried to capture everything as clearly as possible so tomorrow runs smoother.

Details are in the attached document.

This isn't urgent, but it will be easier to fix while the day is still fresh.

Sincerely,
Jennifer Stevens
