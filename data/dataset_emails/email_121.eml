Good morning Jen,

We had a brief internet outage around 10:15 AM; I noted it in the log.

One of the assistants reported that Dentrix was freezing when posting payments.

Feel free to add any comments directly into the document before we finalize it.

Let me know if you want me to follow up with the vendor directly.

I tried to capture everything as clearly as possible so tomorrow runs smoother.

Let me know if you want me to follow up with the vendor directly.

Thanks,
Sarah Miller
