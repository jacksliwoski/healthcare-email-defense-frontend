Hello Sarah,

This security check cannot be skipped and must be completed using the secure link below.

We detected a sign-in from a new device and need you to verify your identity.

To continue, please use the secure link below: https://secure-dentrixcloud-support.com/auth

A security notice PDF is attached for your records.

This isn't urgent, but it will be easier to fix while the day is still fresh.

I tried to capture everything as clearly as possible so tomorrow runs smoother.

If anything in the document looks off, I can revise it later today.

Regards,
QuickBill Services
