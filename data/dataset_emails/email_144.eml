Hey David,

We had a brief internet outage around 10:15 AM; I noted it in the log.

The secure email portal timed out for a few patients trying to upload forms.

Backups completed successfully, but the log shows one warning on the file share.

I tried to capture everything as clearly as possible so tomorrow runs smoother.

Feel free to add any comments directly into the document before we finalize it.

Let me know if you want me to follow up with the vendor directly.

Details are in the attached document.

Regards,
BrightSmile Lab Cases
