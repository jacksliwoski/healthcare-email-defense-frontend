Good afternoon Marcus,

Please double-check the consent form for the patient we added at 3:30 PM.

The updated treatment plan for the implant case is included in the document.

We had two cancellations this afternoon; both have been added back to the recall list.

Let me know if you want me to follow up with the vendor directly.

Details are in the attached document.

If anything in the document looks off, I can revise it later today.

Let me know if you want me to follow up with the vendor directly.

This isn't urgent, but it will be easier to fix while the day is still fresh.

Best,
BrightSmile Lab Cases
