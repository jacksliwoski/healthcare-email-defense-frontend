Good morning Marcus,

Can you confirm if the new burs were logged into the supply cabinet?

The disinfectant wipes backorder has an expected ship date for next week.

Let me know if you want me to follow up with the vendor directly.

I tried to capture everything as clearly as possible so tomorrow runs smoother.

If anything in the document looks off, I can revise it later today.

Details are in the attached document.

Let me know if you want me to follow up with the vendor directly.

Appreciate it,
Dentrix Cloud Support
