Good morning David,

Pre-auth for the molar root canal is still pending; they requested more documentation.

Please review the EOB summary and confirm the write-offs look correct.

Delta is asking for additional charting before approving the perio maintenance.

Let me know if you want me to follow up with the vendor directly.

I've attached a quick export in case you want to review the raw data.

Feel free to add any comments directly into the document before we finalize it.

This isn't urgent, but it will be easier to fix while the day is still fresh.

Thanks,
