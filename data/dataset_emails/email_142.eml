Hi Dr. Martinez,

MetLife flagged a duplicate claim; we may need to resubmit with corrected dates.

This isn't urgent, but it will be easier to fix while the day is still fresh.

I tried to capture everything as clearly as possible so tomorrow runs smoother.

If anything in the document looks off, I can revise it later today.

Details are in the attached document.

This isn't urgent, but it will be easier to fix while the day is still fresh.
