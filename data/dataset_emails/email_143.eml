Good morning Dr. Martinez,

The new composite shades came in, but two boxes were short on units.

We're starting to run low on medium nitrile gloves and prophy paste.

The disinfectant wipes backorder has an expected ship date for next week.

If anything in the document looks off, I can revise it later today.

Let me know if you want me to follow up with the vendor directly.

This isn't urgent, but it will be easier to fix while the day is still fresh.

Best,
Carestream Support
