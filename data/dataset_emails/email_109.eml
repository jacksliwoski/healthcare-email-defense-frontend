Hello Marcus,

The imaging workstation in Operatory 2 dropped off the network twice this morning.

We had a brief internet outage around 10:15 AM; I noted it in the log.

The secure email portal timed out for a few patients trying to upload forms.

This isn't urgent, but it will be easier to fix while the day is still fresh.

Feel free to add any comments directly into the document before we finalize it.

Best,
Kyle Bennett
