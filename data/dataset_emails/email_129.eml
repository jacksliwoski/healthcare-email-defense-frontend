Good afternoon Jen,

Please double-check the consent form for the patient we added at 3:30 PM.

I attached the notes for the three crown patients from this morning.

I tried to capture everything as clearly as possible so tomorrow runs smoother.

I've attached a quick export in case you want to review the raw data.
