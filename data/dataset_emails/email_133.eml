Hello Sarah,

We had two cancellations this afternoon; both have been added back to the recall list.

This isn't urgent, but it will be easier to fix while the day is still fresh.

If anything in the document looks off, I can revise it later today.

Let me know if you want me to follow up with the vendor directly.

Best,
Jennifer Stevens
