Good morning David,

I included the updated inventory sheet for the hygiene rooms.

Can you confirm if the new burs were logged into the supply cabinet?

If anything in the document looks off, I can revise it later today.

I tried to capture everything as clearly as possible so tomorrow runs smoother.

The attached PDF has all the details summarized.

If anything in the document looks off, I can revise it later today.

Sincerely,
