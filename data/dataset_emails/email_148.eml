Good afternoon Sarah,

We had two cancellations this afternoon; both have been added back to the recall list.

Please double-check the consent form for the patient we added at 3:30 PM.

The updated treatment plan for the implant case is included in the document.

Let me know if you want me to follow up with the vendor directly.

If anything in the document looks off, I can revise it later today.

Best,
Patterson Dental Support
