Good morning Sarah,

I included the updated inventory sheet for the hygiene rooms.

Feel free to add any comments directly into the document before we finalize it.

This isn't urgent, but it will be easier to fix while the day is still fresh.

I tried to capture everything as clearly as possible so tomorrow runs smoother.

This isn't urgent, but it will be easier to fix while the day is still fresh.

If anything in the document looks off, I can revise it later today.

Thanks,
Marcus Thorne
